  "summary": "REQ-9 appears implemented by setting ThemeProvider to default to dark mode (and disabling system theme). REQ-10 is not met because the public project page (and preview) still uses hardcoded gray/white backgrounds and includes a custom gradient background, rather than consistently using the existing design tokens (bg-background/text-foreground, card/muted/primary).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Ensure the public project page (/p/$projectId) renders correctly in dark mode and remains consistent with the app’s non-blue/non-purple primary visual direction by updating its theme styling to align with the existing design tokens (bg-background/text-foreground, card/muted/primary) rather than hardcoded gray/purple classes.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the public page still applies hardcoded `bg-white text-gray-900` and `bg-gray-950 text-gray-50` for light/dark themes, and uses a custom gradient background for `custom`, instead of consistently relying on the app’s token-based classes (e.g., `bg-background text-foreground`, `bg-card`, etc.). This conflicts with the requirement to avoid hardcoded gray/purple styling and align with design tokens.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on default dark theme and token-based styling for the public project page; it does not request implementing or changing markdown parsing/rendering logic.",
